# Description
Hangman is a classic word game implemented using React with TypeScript and i18n (internationalization) for language support. The game involves guessing a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The player wins if they successfully guess the word before running out of attempts or "hangs" if they exceed the maximum allowed incorrect guesses.

# About the Project
This Hangman game was built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and i18n to provide an interactive and educational gaming experience. The project showcases the use of modern web technologies to create an engaging and user-friendly game.

# How I Created This App
### Technologies Used
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and ensures a consistent design throughout the application.

i18n: Internationalization library for supporting multiple languages in the application.

### Logical Thinking
Building the Hangman game required careful logical thinking to implement key features:

Word Selection Logic: Choosing words randomly from predefined lists based on the selected language (English or Hebrew).

User Input Handling: Implementing logic to handle user input, validate it, and update the game state accordingly.

Game State Management: Managing the game state, including tracking guessed letters, determining wins or losses, and updating the UI accordingly.

Sound Integration: Adding sound effects for various game events, such as winning, losing, and correct letter guesses.

UI/UX Design: Creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to enhance the gaming experience.
